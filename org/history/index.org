* History
** Creation
*** Narrative 1: The Cosmic Weaving
Culter: The Ariathians
Inspiration: Middle Earth, Narnia

In the beginning, Almoras was a vast, empty void. The celestial beings, known as the Elder Weavers, existed in this emptiness, each embodying an aspect of creation: Light, Darkness, Life, Death, and Time. These Elder Weavers combined their powers to weave the fabric of Almoras, with each thread representing a different aspect of the world.

Light and Darkness wove the heavens, creating the sun, stars, and moon.
Life and Death shaped the land, giving rise to mountains, forests, rivers, and oceans, as well as the cycle of birth and rebirth.
Time bound the weave together, ensuring the continuity and progression of events.
From the fabric of creation emerged the first beings, known as the Primordials, who were tasked with nurturing the world. Over eons, the Primordials gave birth to the races and creatures of Almoras, each imbued with a fragment of the Elder Weavers' essence.

*** Narrative 2: The Eternal Song
Culture: The Harmonites
Inspiration: Middle Earth, Elder Scrolls

Almoras began as a harmonious song sung by the Eternal Choir, a group of divine entities. Each member of the choir sang a different note, representing an element of creation—earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. Their song resonated through the void, shaping the world with its melody.

Earth formed the solid ground and towering mountains.
Air brought the winds and sky.
Fire ignited the sun and stars.
Water filled the oceans and rivers.
Spirit infused all living things with vitality and consciousness.
As the song continued, the world of Almoras blossomed into existence. However, one member of the choir, driven by a desire for power, introduced dissonance into the song, creating conflict and chaos. This discordant note gave rise to challenges and struggles, shaping the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of Almoras.

*** Narrative 3: The Dream of the Ancients
Culture: The Somnorians
Inspiration: Narnia, Urth

Almoras was born from the dreams of the Ancients, a race of powerful beings who existed before time. The Ancients, in their slumber, envisioned a world of wonder and magic, and their dreams took shape in the void, becoming the reality of Almoras.

The Ancient of Dreams dreamt of the land, creating vast landscapes filled with beauty and danger.
The Ancient of Nightmares dreamt of the creatures, populating the world with both benevolent and malevolent beings.
The Ancient of Time dreamt of history, weaving the past, present, and future into a continuous flow.
When the Ancients awoke, they found Almoras fully formed and teeming with life. They chose to guide their creation from afar, leaving behind artifacts and ancient texts to aid the inhabitants in times of need.

*** Narrative 4: The Elemental Confluence
Culture: The Elemental Confluence
Inspiration: Latro's World, Elder Scrolls

Almoras was forged from the confluence of the Five Elemental Realms: Terra (Earth), Aqua (Water), Ignis (Fire), Aeris (Air), and Aether (Spirit). Each realm was ruled by an Elemental Sovereign, who sought to expand their dominion.

The Sovereigns met at the Confluence, a mystical nexus where all elements converged. They agreed to combine their powers to create a new world, Almoras, where all elements could coexist in harmony.
The Sovereigns infused the land with their essence, giving rise to elemental regions where their influence was strongest. Terra created the mountains and forests, Aqua filled the seas and rivers, Ignis lit the skies with suns and stars, Aeris formed the winds and clouds, and Aether breathed life into the world.
The Elemental Sovereigns continue to watch over Almoras, their influence felt in the natural phenomena and magical forces that shape the world.

*** Narrative 5: The Divine Architects
Culture: The Architectians
Inspiration: Elder Scrolls, Middle Earth

In the beginning, the Divine Architects—a pantheon of gods and goddesses—conceived the idea of Almoras as a grand project. Each Architect had a specific domain and responsibility in the creation process.

Aurelia, Goddess of Light, brought illumination and warmth.
Nyx, God of Darkness, provided rest and reflection.
Gaia, Goddess of Earth, shaped the land and its resources.
Poseidon, God of Water, filled the world with oceans and rivers.
Hephaestus, God of Craft, imbued the world with the spark of creation and invention.
The Architects worked together to build Almoras, infusing it with their divine essence. They left behind monuments and relics as reminders of their presence, and their guidance can still be sought by those who prove worthy.
